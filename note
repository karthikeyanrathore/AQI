What is Time Series?

Two types of Model
1. Regression model.(non-time series way)
2. Non - Regression model. (Auto-regression)

Suppose you want to predict the no. of ice creams going to sell on a particular day.

1. non-time series way.
input feature: temp
output: cones

temp == cones (hot temp == more sales of cones)

ex.
let ct be no. of ice-cream that were sold on a given day.

if we plot graph ct vs temp. & based on the graph.
we predict no. of sale of ice-cream cones given a particular temperature for tmw.
this will have errors.

this way of predicting value from data is know Interpolation.
Interpolation: predicting new data from history where data is in the range of history and not outside the range.
Interpolation will have good accuracy of the model.



2. Time series way.
predicting no. of ice-cream sale on any given day as a fuction of how many cones  sold yesterday.
input feature: c(t-1)
output: cones

prediting data based on lagged version of the cones sold (model does NOT depend on temperature).

ALWAYS Extrapolation: predicting new data outside the given data.

problem:
prediction intervals growes bigger and bigger meaning
let k : predicting value for tmw from prev uncertain data.
day after tmw: k  + k = 2k (uncertainity increases).
k, 2k, ....BAD  

GOOD for short come prediction.
