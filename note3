Air Quality index is used by government firm to check the status of air quality of certain location and each 
government firm  have there own air quality indices. The air quality index is sorted into six bracket i.e
Good, Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very poor and Severe. In India, if the air quality index of certain region
is above 300, it gets in "Very Poor" bracket which can influence the health of general public and this unpleasant
AQI is caused by the pollutants present in the air such as Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2),
Ozone (O3), Benzene, Toluene, Xylene , PM2.5 and PM10. 

There are mainly two category of pollutants which is effecting air quality index of a region i.e  Carbon monoxide (CO),
Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Toluene, Benzene, Xylene, PM2.5 and PM10. 
Carbon monoxide (CO) comes under the branch of primary pollutants and it is caused by burning wood or any other fuel.
It has no color, taste or odor. Carbon monoxide is poisonous gas which take major part in effecting the air quality.
Sulphur dioxide (SO2)
